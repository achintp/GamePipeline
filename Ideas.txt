Strategies for the defender:

Non-adaptive strategies:

1. Randomized renewal strategy - 
	a. Will pick from a range of periods according to a given probability distribution
	Parameters: Probability distribution over a range

	b. Will follow some exponential queue process for generating attack timings
	Parameters: Lambda or equivalent mean time

2. Refactory randomized renewal strategy - 
	a. The inclusion of a refactory period after each move, and then generating the strategies in the same way as above
	Parameters: refactory time that can change depending on the number of servers under control + previous parameters

Adaptive Strategies:

1. Stochastic Probe Count - Based on the knowledge of the Bernoulli distribution of the attack succeeding for a given server at a point of time, the defender will 'simulate' an attack to decide whether it will succeed or not and reimage
Parameters: probability function

2. Control N - The defender aims to control N servers. At any time period it evaluates the 'health' of the system by calculating the probability of owning at least N servers. At a certain threshold it will rebalance to own N by reimaging.


Strategies for the attacker:

Non-Adaptive:

1. Analogous to the above
2. Periodic Decept

Adaptive:

1. Conrol N: The attacker aims to control N of the servers at any point of time. Given the downtime period.
